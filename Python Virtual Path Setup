Suppose you have installed both python 2 and 3 in your machine
Say the command line setup for python 2 is py and python 3 is python ( It can be setup through environment variables)
Isntall virtualenv module for both python2 and python3 using "py -m pip install virtualenv" and "python -m pip install virtualenv" respectively.
Now create project for python2 as "py -m virtualenv your_name_for_virtualenv_directory" and python3 as "python -m virtualenv your_name_for_virtualenv_directory".
Finally, go to Scripts directiory and run activate.exe from command line. You are ready to use either python2 or python3 depending on your setup. Enjoy!
Note: Python 3 comes with builtin virtualenv so one can use (recommend for python3): python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
